Create a node environment

To setup a private instance, create a MongoDB locally and create a "forum" and a "website" database. Inside website create a "Users" collection. The forum's database collections will auto-generate. You will have to re-run the app after it generates as it will throw an error.

After that you <i>should</i> be able to run the website locally.

If you cannot please email me and I will update the github
